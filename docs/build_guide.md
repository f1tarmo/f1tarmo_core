For now, just link to the engineering nonsense reddit page to use those
instructions.

Eventually, I'd like this page to detail:
- Prerequisites for the build process
- Tools needed/recommended.
- A link to all the 3D model files.
- Eventually, maybe a 3MF file that contains all the print settings as well.

I should also discuss choosing *which* variant to build. I.e., there may be
different variants of the chassis for different battery types.

In addition to assembling the car itself, also need a section on how to connect
everything. I.e., adding XT60 connectors to the VESC, connecting things to the
DIN rail terminals for power, etc.
