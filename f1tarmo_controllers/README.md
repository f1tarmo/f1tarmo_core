TODO: Describe how this package effectively contains node(s) that serve as a
"vehicle command interface" -- calling them "controllers" is really just comes
from the ros2control lingo. I guess that's technically the correct name for
them, but that could be a tad misleading to newcomers. Mainly because
"controller" is often thrown around when talking about algorithms like pure
pursuit, or a trajectory tracking mpc controller, for example.
