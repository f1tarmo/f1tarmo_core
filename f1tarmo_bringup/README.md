# f1tarmo_bringup

TODO: Once I have a high level architecture / interface control document for the
f1tarmo_core nodes, make a diagram that depicts which parts of that architecture
each node (from all the launch files involved) is implementing.

This way, it's easy for folks to understand what is actually being brought up as
a part of the launch file, and what each of those pieces is doing/implementing
as a part of the whole system. Not only does this make debugging easier, but it
makes it much easier to understand how to swap out different pieces of the
stack, as you know exactly what each piece's interface must be.
