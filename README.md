TODO: Document each node in the core f1tarmo package (and its interface).
TODO: Create a simple diagram depicting the interface that all the nodes in the
f1tarmo core (this repo) provided/implement. In the demo workspaces, there will
be docs there that show how the "block" that these core nodes implement will
connect with other blocks from higher level autonomy modules/blocks.
