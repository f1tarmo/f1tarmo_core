# f1tarmo
F1TENTH car based on Engineering Nonsense's Tarmo 5

TODO: Insert image of the f1tenth build here.

The f1tarmo platform is a low cost alternative to the popular f1tenth (now
roboracer) platform, and is largely just a combination of different projects
from around the robotics community.

- 


. If you are familiar with the f1tenth platform,
the key differences to the platform are:
- The chassis is almost entirely 3D printed.

If you're familiar with the f1tenth ecosystem,
then you'll be right at home with the f1tarmo--the core software stack is
largely the same.

The resulting platform's hardware and software are all
derived from different projects, including: (UPDATE)

TODO: Document each node in the core f1tarmo package (and its interface).
TODO: Create a simple diagram depicting the interface that all the nodes in the
f1tarmo core (this repo) provided/implement. In the demo workspaces, there will
be docs there that show how the "block" that these core nodes implement will
connect with other blocks from higher level autonomy modules/blocks.
